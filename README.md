Using Ordinary Differential Equations To Analyze Indian Stock Indices
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As part of course project for MA201, we have worked on Ordinary Differential Equations for analysing
and predicting the movement of SENSEX and NIFTY 50

Project Brief
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stock markets and indices often draw a lot of attention. Though, a large number of
people dive into the stock market without research and analysis, resulting in their financial
bloodbath. Through this project, we will use the ordinary differential equations in analysing
the Indian Stock Indices and predict the stock indices movement. We will treat the stock
indices as a dynamic system that iterates with time. We will also be using the logistic growth
model, originally developed by mathematician Verhulst to predict population growth in
predicting the indices depending on certain factors. If possible, we also plan to extend our
predictions to other stocks and consider multiple factors while analysing the same
